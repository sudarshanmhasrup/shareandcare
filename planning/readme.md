#### Background Story
I'll start with the background story of this project. Every project has its own story behind its existence, and this 
project also has its background story. I'm not a storyteller, but I'll try to explain it to you.

So it all started when I took a bunk in a lecture in college for once. I met another friend of mine whose name is 
`Hardik Sancheti`. While talking to him, I got to know that he needs a website for his tours and travels business. 
He was worried about the cost of making a website, and then suddenly I asked him if I could develop a mobile app for 
your business, and he agreed. After he agreed, I decided to work on this project.

#### Proposed solutions
My proposed solution for this project includes the development of a primary mobile application for customers, followed by two additional components:

- `Customer App`: A mobile application for users to book and manage tickets. 
- `Admin Panel`: A centralized platform to oversee and manage all services.
- `Driver App`: A dedicated app for drivers to scan and verify bus tickets when passengers board.
